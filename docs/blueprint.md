## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft sky blue (#87CEEB) evoking clarity and trust. It suggests precision but remains inviting, a good fit for a finance-related tool.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), a barely-there tint of the primary color for subtle unity. Using it creates a soothing and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted lavender (#D8BFD8), positioned analogously to the blue, provides a contrast for interactive elements without overwhelming the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif provides a neutral, objective feel, great for both headers and body text.
- Use a set of simple, monochromatic icons for key actions and data points, focused on clarity and ease of understanding.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with generous spacing to prevent clutter and improve readability.
- Subtle transitions and micro-interactions provide feedback and guide the user through the app, enhancing the feeling of flow.
